HOW TO MAKE THE APPLICATION GO:

INSTALL DEPENDENCIES:
- (if necessary) Download node.js (and, by association, npm): https://nodejs.org/en/
- Ensure node is installed: `$ node -v`
- Ensure npm is installed: `$ npm -v`
- Navigate to where this repo is installed locally, and install dependencies: `$ npm install`

RUN PROGRAM:
- If you've navigated your CLI to this repo, run: `$ npm run app`

If successful, expect to see a message detailing the number of successful inserts
outputted in the console with no error messages. Note that some processes may fail if the files aren't setup
correctly, but that will not stop correctly formatted instances from succeeding.
